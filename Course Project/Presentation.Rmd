## About 

This is the presentation for a `shiny app` The app will
take the user's height as in input and will display the predicted weight
of the user.

## How

**Single Variable Regression** : we will apply a simple regression
algorithm. In the next slide we will see the relationship between the two
variable `height` and `weight`.

```{r , echo=T, comment=''}
head(women)
```

## Plot

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
data(women)
plot(women$height, women$weight, xlab = "Women's Height", ylab = "Women's Weight", bty = "n", pch = 16)
abline(lm(women$weight ~ women$height), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

## Model Prediction

```{r , eval=FALSE, echo=T}
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  model <- lm(weight ~ height, data = women)
  model1pred <- reactive({
    HeightInput <- input$sliderH
    predict(model, newdata = data.frame(height = HeightInput))
  })
```

## Prediction Example

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
